Because the cut\\npredicate has only a procedural meaning, clauses containing cut cannot be\\nlearned using an extensional evaluation method, as is done in most learning\\nsystems. On the other hand, searching a space of possible programs (instead of\\na space of independent clauses) is unfeasible. An alternative solution is to\\ngenerate first a candidate base program which covers the positive examples, and\\nthen make it consistent by inserting cut where appropriate. The problem of\\nlearning programs with cut has not been investigated before and this seems to\\nbe a natural and reasonable approach. We generalize this scheme and investigate\\nthe difficulties that arise. Some of the major shortcomings are actually\\ncaused, in general, by the need for intensional evaluation. As a conclusion,\\nthe analysis of this paper suggests, on precise and technical grounds, that\\nlearning cut is difficult, and current induction techniques should probably be\\nrestricted to purely declarative logic languages.',\n",

       "    'value': 'As real logic programmers normally use cut (!), an effective learning\\nprocedure for logic programs should be able to deal with it. Because the cut\\npredicate has only a procedural meaning, clauses containing cut cannot be\\nlearned using an extensional evaluation method, as is done in most learning\\nsystems. On the other hand, searching a space of possible programs (instead of\\na space of independent clauses) is unfeasible. An alternative solution is to\\ngenerate first a candidate base program which covers the positive examples, and\\nthen make it consistent by inserting cut where appropriate. The problem of\\nlearning programs with cut has not been investigated before and this seems to\\nbe a natural and reasonable approach. We generalize this scheme and investigate\\nthe difficulties that arise. Some of the major shortcomings are actually\\ncaused, in general, by the need for intensional evaluation.

In addition to the minimum description length principle, other\\nbackground knowledge can be used by SUBDUE to guide the search towards more\\nappropriate substructures. Experiments in a variety of domains demonstrate\\nSUBDUE's ability to find substructures capable of compressing the original data\\nand to discover structural concepts important to the domain. Description of\\nOnline Appendix: This is a compressed tar file containing the SUBDUE discovery\\nsystem, written in C. The program accepts as input databases represented in\\ngraph form, and will output discovered substructures with their corresponding\\nvalue.\"},\n",

This phenomenon hurts the forward propagation of long-term\\ncontext information, as well as learning a hidden state representation to\\nrepresent long-term context, which depends on propagating credit information\\nbackwards in time. Using results from Markov chain theory, we show that this\\nproblem of diffusion of context and credit is reduced when the transition\\nprobabilities approach 0 or 1, i.e., the transition probability matrices are\\nsparse and the model essentially deterministic.

The main reason is that there is a well-known and simple technique\\nto compute least general generalizations under theta-subsumption, but not under\\nimplication. However generalization under theta-subsumption is inappropriate\\nfor learning recursive clauses, which is a crucial problem since recursion is\\nthe basic program structure of logic programs. We note that implication between\\nclauses is undecidable, and we therefore introduce a stronger form of\\nimplication, called T-implication, which is decidable between clauses. We show\\nthat for every finite set of clauses there exists a least general\\ngeneralization under T-implication. We describe a technique to reduce\\ngeneralizations under implication of a clause to generalizations under\\ntheta-subsumption of what we call an expansion of the original clause.
